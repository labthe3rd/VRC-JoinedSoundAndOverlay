A script that plays a sound and/or displays an overlay to players currently in the instance when another joins. It does not play the sound or display the overlay for the player joining. I realized that VRChat's OnPlayerJoined Event also is triggered for the joining player so I made a public workaround for this. 

Required Packages

VRCSDK3

UdonSharp

This package was created to share the script but feel free to use the audio clips and text mesh pro font if you want. 

To use the prefab drag and drop into your scene. You can change the sound via the audio source and can edit the TMP font/position to your liking!
